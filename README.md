*\* Structure in the banner is generated by BuilderGPT with model `gemini-2.5-pro`.*

A generative Minecraft structure tool for the [Cynia Agents](https://github.com/CyniaAI/CyniaAgents) framework.

BuilderGPT lets you describe a building and have a language model produce a ready-to-use schematic. The component outputs either a `.schem` file or a `.mcfunction` script that can be imported into the game with tools like WorldEdit.

## ðŸŽ‰ BuilderGPT on ChatGPT is LIVE on the GPTs Store!

Weâ€™re so excited to announce that **BuilderGPT on ChatGPT** is officially available on the **ChatGPT GPTs Store**. This is a **purely non-profit** GPT that lets you generate Minecraft building files instantlyâ€”no local setup needed.

**Whatâ€™s the difference?**

* **BuilderGPT (Local, open-source & free):**
  Built on the **CyniaAgents** framework. You run it on your own machine, configure the environment, and use **your own API key**.
* **BuilderGPT on ChatGPT (new):**
  Runs entirely inside ChatGPT and our cloud server. **No install, no keys, no config.** From today, you can use **OpenAIâ€™s GPT-5** model **for free** to quickly get the files you want!

* Zero setupâ€”just open and build
* Fast, consistent outputs powered by GPT-5
* Free to use, community-first

**Try it Here** https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68e21df749f48191b94f57c3d5faa57a-mc-builder-buildergpt

## Installation

1. Install the Cynia Agents framework by following the instructions in its repository.
2. Copy this `BuilderGPT` folder into the framework's `components/` directory.
3. Install the requirements in the same Python environment:
   ```bash
   pip install -r components/BuilderGPT/requirements.txt
   ```
4. Start the Cynia Agents UI (`python -m streamlit run web.py`).
5. Enable **BuilderGPT** from the *Component Center* page.

## Usage

After enabling, a new **BuilderGPT** page appears in the sidebar. Select your Minecraft version, choose an export format and describe the structure you want. The component will call the configured LLM provider and save the resulting file inside the `generated/` folder.

## Features

- Generate structures using natural language
- Export as `.schem` or `.mcfunction`
- Works entirely within Cynia Agents

## Credits

- [MCBench (mcbench.ai)](https://mcbench.ai) â€” BuilderGPTâ€™s support for a JavaScript-based building/structure representation and elements of its prompting approach are inspired by MCBench. The JavaScript parsing and integration code used here was implemented independently for this project.
